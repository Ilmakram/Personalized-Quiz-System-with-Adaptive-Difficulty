SQL Focus: Questions, Users, Attempts, Scores, and Difficulty Levels.

OOP Focus: Quiz, Question, User, and Score classes, with inheritance for question types (MCQ, True/False, Short Answer).

Innovation: Adaptive difficulty logic implemented via OOP, modifying next questions based on past performance.

Example: The Question class hierarchy supports different question types and validation logic.
